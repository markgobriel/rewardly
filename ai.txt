We used AI to help us develop this web application in the following ways:

Salman:
- Debugging errors related to the backend API endpoints (adding console.log statements to see intermediate values).
- Create sample data to test with organizers for Calendar.
- Used AI to help implement Calendar.jsx, I would ask it to add things like buttons, or a header, and then debug it
  to make sure it was working correctly. There would often be issues where a higher-clearance user couldn't see
  something on the calendar that they should, so I would use AI to help debug these issues.
- I also used AI to modify the Event card modal which would appear after clicking an event in the calendar.


Chifeng:
- Help debug issues and identify potential errors in code.
- Create sample data to test with organizers for transactions.
- Generate multiple versions of certain components with minor variations for experimentation and testing purposes.
    - for example, I used it to transfer over the work done for events/:eventId to promotions/:promotionId and transactions/:transactionId
    - I also used it to give me a framework to add functionality on for Event Dashboard
    - I also used it to copy over boilerplate for tab state management as well as form state management from transaction to every other form
- Aid in CSS work to style components and refine their visual appearance.


Mark:
- To generate frontend mock data before the backend was ready, so I could build and verify UI flows.
- For a concise checklist of missing tasks and next steps to keep frontend and backend integration on track.
  - Asking to look through the rubric/instructions and to tell me what is yet to be completed
- For CSS suggestions and polish while iterating on page layouts and component styling.
  - i.e. keeping a consistent theme/styling throughout the website.
- To guide and validate CRUD testing flows for transactions, promotions, and events until the backend APIs were available.
